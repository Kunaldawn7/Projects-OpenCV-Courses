For this project, we have fine-tuned **YOLOv3** and **YOLOv4** detection models from  AlexeyAB's **DarkNet** [repository](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet ).

The models have been fine-tuned to detect faces of persons with and without masks.

After training both the models, the evaluation metric (**mAP @ 0.5**) are approximately similar. However, on real life video inferences, **YOLOv4** appears to perform slightly better.



The metrics plots for both YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 are shown below:

Finally, we comparison through inferences across a few video samples:
