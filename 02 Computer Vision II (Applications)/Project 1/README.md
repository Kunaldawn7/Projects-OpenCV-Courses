We have built 2 projects from the Course: **Computer Vision: Applications (Python)**.

**Project 1** aims to build a Virtual Makeup application using facial landmarks and techniques such as segmentation, Delaunay Triangulation, alpha blending, etc.

In **Project 2**, we shall fine-tune **YOLOv3** and **YOLOv4** to build a face mask detector to detect faces with and without masks and compare the results.
