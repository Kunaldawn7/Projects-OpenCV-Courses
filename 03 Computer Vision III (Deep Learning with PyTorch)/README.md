We have built 2 projects using the concepts of Deep Learning learnt from the Course.

* **Project 1** is a part of a Kaggle competition on Food Classification using Fine-tuning a pre-trained classification model available in Torchvision.
* The objective of **Project 2** was to build a Licence Plate detector by fine-tuning a COCO-pretrained model available in **Detectron2**.
